# My Dotfiles
On a clean install of any Debian based OS run 
```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/spacey-sooty/Dotfiles.git
cd Dotfiles
chmod +x debian-init.sh
./debian-init.sh
```
I can reasonably guarantee configuration options work on platforms I provide an init for as it means I use them but I make no guarantee.
As of current I have not tested the install scripts so I make no promises they will work. 

## TODO
- docker conf
