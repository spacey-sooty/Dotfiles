# My Dotfiles
On a clean install of any Debian based OS run `chmod +x debian-init.sh && ./debian-init.sh`. I can reasonably guarantee configuration options work on platforms I provide an init for as it means I use them but I make no guarantee. As of current I have not tested the install scripts so I make no promises they will work. 

## TODO
- docker install + conf
- terminal autocomplete
